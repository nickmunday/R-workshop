# Learning `readxl`

We are working with data and it's goinmg to be amazing!

We're going to use packages:
- tidyverse
- readxl
- writexl
- here

```{r packages}
library (tidyverse)
library (readxl)
library (writexl)
library (here)

### this is an annotation in code
```
<!-- this is to hide in non-code chunks
all html tags recognized -->

### Read in fish counts

```{r}
###Read in the fish_counts_curated.csv file
fish_counts <- read_csv(here("r-workshop-data","fish_counts_curated.csv"))
```
